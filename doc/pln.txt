Quickstart                                                    *pln-quickstart*

                                                                   *pln-oauth*
Oauth: ~
	In order to use planner with the Google Calendar feature, you need to get
	a key for the Google Calendar API. Go to the Google cloud console and
	follow this guide: https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/quickstart/python#set-up-environment
	
	* Select the `External` app type and add your email address to the test
	  users.
	* Under the `Google Auth Platform / Data Access` add the scope
	  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` and save.
	* Generate the client json and download it. Remember the file location
	  because you will use it for setup with |pln-quick| or |pln-manual|
                                                                   *pln-quick*
Quickest: ~
>lua
	vim.pack.add {
		"https://github.com/benraz123/",
		-- other plugins
	}

	require "planner".setup("/path/to/oauth/credentials/file")

                                                                  *pln-manual*
Manual: ~
	Note: |pln-quick| is the idiomatic solution but it does the same thing as
	this process
	>vim
	:PlnLoadCredentials {credential path}
	:PlnInstallGcal

Commands                                                        *pln-commands*

:Pln                                                                    *:Pln*
	Opens a new window with a list of the current planner entries, sorted by
	date. Each entry must be written in |pln-syntax| for the program to
	understand it.

:PlnReset                                                          *:PlnReset*
	Deletes all data inside of the data directory. To get back the gcal
	program and credentials file needed for the Google Calendar integration to
	run, see |:PlnInstallGcal| and |:PlnAddCredentials|
	Note:
	The planner is deleted without a backup so if you want a backup you need
	to make one

:PlnInstallGcal                                              *:PlnInstallGcal*
	Essentially performs the following steps: >bash
		$ git clone https://github.com/benraz123/gcal-py
		$ cd gcal-py
		$ make build
		$ cp dist/gcal <DATA DIR>
		$ cd ..
		$ rm -rf gcal-py

:PlnAddCredentials {file}                                 *:PlnAddCredentials*
	Loads the {file} into the data directory for the program to read from.
	Essentially does the same as `cp` {file} `<DATA DIR>/credentials.json
